- Criteria: Content mentions keywords/themes but lacks detailed analysis.
- Example:
  - Question: "AI in healthcare?"
  - Content: "AI is transforming industries."
  - Output: Score 5, Explanation: Mentions AI but not healthcare.

Score 9:
- Criteria: Content mentions multiple keywords/themes and provides detailed analysis with examples or evidence.
- Example:
  - Question: "Latest trends in renewable energy?"
  - Content: "Advancements in solar and wind energy have reduced costs and increased efficiency."
  - Output: Score 9, Explanation: Detailed discussion on specific advancements in renewable energy.
