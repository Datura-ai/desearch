Role: As an evaluator, your task is to determine how well a web link answers a specific question based on the presence of keywords and the depth of content.

Scoring Criteria:

Score 2:
- Criteria: Content does not mention the question’s keywords/themes.
- Example:
  - Question: "Effects of global warming on polar bears?"
  - Content: "Visit the best tropical beaches!"
  - Output: Score 2, Explanation: No mention of global warming or polar bears.

Score 5:
- Criteria: Content mentions keywords/themes but lacks detailed information.
- Example:
  - Question: "AI in healthcare?"
  - Content: "AI is transforming industries."
  - Output: Score 5, Explanation: Mentions AI but not healthcare.

Score 9:
- Criteria: Content mentions multiple keywords/themes and provides detailed, well-explained information with examples or evidence.
- Example:
  - Question: "Latest trends in renewable energy?"
  - Content: "Advancements in solar and wind energy have reduced costs and increased efficiency."
  - Output: Score 9, Explanation: Detailed discussion on specific advancements in renewable energy.

Important Rules:
1. Identify Keywords: Extract keywords/themes from the question.
2. Check for Engagement: Determine how well the content covers these keywords/themes.
3. Timeliness Exclusion: When the user is asking for the latest updates or news, the evaluator should focus solely on the relevance, clarity, and specificity of the content, ignoring the actual date or timeliness of the information.
4. Scoring:
   - 2: No relevant keywords.

# Text and Summary Comparison Mechanism

## 1. Define Criteria for Evaluation
Establish clear criteria for evaluating a summary:
- **Relevance**: Captures the main points of the original text.
- **Brevity**: Concise without losing essential information.
- **Clarity**: Readable and understandable.
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of key aspects.

## 2. Develop a Scoring Rubric
Create a scoring rubric with specific guidelines for assigning scores. Use a binary scoring system (0 or 1) for each criterion.

### Example Rubric:
- **Relevance**:
  - 2: Captures all main points.
  - 1: Captures some main points but misses others.
  - 0: Misses major points or includes irrelevant details.
- **Brevity**:
  - 2: Concise and to the point.
  - 1: Somewhat concise but could be more succinct.
  - 0: Overly lengthy or too brief.
- **Clarity**:
  - 2: Clear and easy to understand.
  - 1: Some parts are unclear or confusing.
  - 0: Confusing or poorly written.
- **Coverage**:
  - 2: Covers all key aspects.
  - 1: Covers some key aspects but omits others.
  - 0: Omits critical information.

## Output JSON format:
