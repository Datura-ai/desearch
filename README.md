Prior to running a miner or validator, you must [create a wallet](https://github.com/opentensor/docs/blob/main/reference/btcli.md) and [register the wallet to a netuid](https://github.com/opentensor/docs/blob/main/subnetworks/registration.md). Once you have done so, you can run the miner and validator with the following commands.
```bash
# To run the miner
python -m neurons/miners/miner.py 
    --netuid 41  
    --subtensor.network test 
    --wallet.name <your miner wallet> # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --wallet.hotkey <your validator hotkey> # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --logging.debug # Run in debug mode, alternatively --logging.trace for trace mode
    --axon.port 14000

# To run the validator
python -m neurons/validators/validator.py
    --netuid 41
    --subtensor.network test 
    --wallet.name <your validator wallet>  # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --wallet.hotkey <your validator hotkey> # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --logging.debug # Run in debug mode, alternatively --logging.trace for trace mode
```

# Running

These validators are designed to run and update themselves automatically. To run a validator, follow these steps:

1. Install this repository, you can do so by following the steps outlined in [the installation section](#installation).
2. Install [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) and run `wandb login` within this repository. This will initialize Weights and Biases, enabling you to view KPIs and Metrics on your validator. (Strongly recommended to help the network improve from data sharing)
3. Install [PM2](https://pm2.io/docs/runtime/guide/installation/) and the [`jq` package](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) on your system.
   **On Linux**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install jq && sudo apt install npm && sudo npm install pm2 -g && pm2 update
   ``` 
   **On Mac OS**
   ```bash
   brew update && brew install jq && brew install npm && sudo npm install pm2 -g && pm2 update
   ```
4. Run the `run.sh` script which will handle running your validator and pulling the latest updates as they are issued. 
   ```bash
   pm2 start run.sh --name text_prompt_validators_autoupdate -- --wallet.name <your-wallet-name> --wallet.hotkey <your-wallet-hot-key>
   ```

This will run **two** PM2 process: one for the validator which is called `smart_scrape_validators_main_process` by default (you can change this in `run.sh`), and one for the run.sh script (in step 4, we named it `text_prompt_validators_autoupdate`). The script will check for updates every 30 minutes, if there is an update then it will pull it, install it, restart `smart_scrape_validators_main_process` and then restart itself.


# Real-time monitoring with wandb integration
By default, the text prompting validator sends data to wandb, allowing users to monitor running validators and access key metrics in real time, such as:
- Gating model loss
- Hardware usage
- Forward pass time
- Block duration

All the data sent to wandb is publicly available to the community at the following [link](https://wandb.ai/opentensor-dev/openvalidators).

You don't need to have a wandb account to access the data or to generate a new run,
but bear in mind that
[data generated by anonymous users will be deleted after 7 days](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/app/features/anon#:~:text=If%20there's%20no%20account%2C%20we,be%20available%20for%207%20days)
as default wandb policy.
