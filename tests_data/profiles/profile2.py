However, existing feature selection algorithms often suffer from complexity and a lack of interpretability, making it difficult for decision-makers to extract value, manage risks, and adhere to compliance regulations in a thoroughly explainable way. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causality-based feature selection technique that embeds an explainable unsupervised feature selection algorithm. We refer to our proposed method as Causal Feature Selection with Minimum Redundancy (CFSMR). Our method yields a minimum viable feature set without compromising model performance while ensuring interpretability. We conduct an experimental study to compare the proposed technique with conventional feature selection techniques. Our results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms or performs on par with existing techniques, making it a promising approach for decision-makers seeking an effective and interpretable feature selection method.",

Machine learning product development lifecycle must take into account the need to navigate the difficulties of developing and deploying machine learning models. evoML is an AI-powered tool that provides automated functionalities in machine learning model development, optimisation, and model code optimisation. Core functionalities of evoML include data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature analysis and generation, model optimisation, model evaluation, model code optimisation, and model deployment. Additionally, a key feature of evoML is that it embeds code and model optimisation into the model development process, and includes multi-objective optimisation capabilities.",
